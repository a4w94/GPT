    "article": "Quantum mechanics developed over many decades, beginning as a set of controversial mathematical explanations for experiments that the mathematics of classical mechanics could not explain, according to the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. It started at the turn of the 20th century, around the same time Albert Einstein published his theory of relativity, a separate revolution in physics that describes the motion of things at high speeds. Unlike relativity, however, the origins of quantum mechanics cannot be attributed to a single scientist. Rather, multiple scientists contributed to a foundation that gradually gained acceptance and experimental verification between the late 1800s and 1930.\n\nIn 1900, German physicist Max Planck was trying to explain why objects at specific temperatures, like the 1,470-degree-Fahrenheit (800 degrees Celsius) filament of a light bulb, glowed a specific color — in this case, red, according to the Perimeter Institute. Planck realized that equations used by physicist Ludwig Boltzmann to describe the behavior of gases could be translated into an explanation for this relationship between temperature and color. The problem was that Boltzmann's work relied on the fact that any given gas was made from tiny particles, meaning that light, too, was made from discrete bits.\n\nThis idea flew in the face of ideas about light at the time, when most physicists believed that light was a continuous wave and not a tiny packet. Planck himself didn't believe in either atoms or discrete bits of light, but his concept was given a boost in 1905, when Einstein published a paper, \"Concerning an Heuristic Point of View Toward the Emission and Transformation of Light.\"\n\nEinstein envisioned light traveling not as a wave, but as some manner of \"energy quanta.\" This packet of energy, Einstein suggested in his paper, could \"be absorbed or generated only as a whole,\" specifically when an atom \"jumps\" between quantized vibration rates. This is where the \"quantum\" part of quantum mechanics comes from.\n\nWith this new way to conceive of light, Einstein offered insights into the behavior of nine phenomena in his paper, including the specific colors that Planck described being emitted from a light bulb filament. It also explained how certain colors of light could eject electrons off metal surfaces — a phenomenon known as the photoelectric effect.",
